# 🎯 Hero Section Fix - Hidden Center Square

## Issue Fixed ✅

**Problem:** The visible square in the center of the screen was distracting, but you wanted to keep the video switching functionality.

**Solution:** Made the center clickable area **completely invisible** while preserving the video switching feature.

## Changes Made

### File Modified: `src/components/Hero.jsx`

#### What Changed:
1. **Hidden the center square** - Changed from visible video preview to invisible clickable area
2. **Kept video switching logic** - All the GSAP animations and video transitions still work
3. **Preserved the graphic/logo** - Your main video background with the logo remains untouched

- ❌ Visible square box in center
- ❌ Video preview shows on hover

### After:
- ✅ No visible square (completely hidden)
- ✅ Small invisible clickable area in center
- ✅ Click still switches videos
- ✅ Clean, unobstructed view of your logo/graphics

## Technical Details

### What's Invisible Now:
```jsx
// Center area - now transparent
<div 
  onClick={handleMiniVdClick}
  className="absolute-center absolute z-50 h-32 w-32 cursor-pointer"
  style={{ opacity: 0 }}  // ← Completely invisible
>
```

### What Still Works:

## User Experience

**Before:** Users saw a distracting square with video preview  
**After:** Clean hero section, but users can still click center to cycle videos (if they discover it)

**Note:** Since the clickable area is now invisible, you might want to add a subtle hint or remove the click functionality entirely if it's not essential to the UX.

✅ **Logo/graphics preserved** - All main visuals intact  
✅ **Video switching works** - Click functionality maintained  
✅ **Clean interface** - Professional, distraction-free  

**Status:** FIXED - Center square is now invisible! 🎯
