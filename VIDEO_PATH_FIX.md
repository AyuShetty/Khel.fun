# 🎯 Video Path Fix - Video Now Visible

## Issue Fixed ✅

**Problem:** Video wasn't showing because:
1. ❌ `hero.mp4` doesn't exist in the videos folder
2. ❌ Video path was missing leading slash
3. ❌ Loading logic was waiting for multiple videos

**Solution:** 
1. ✅ Changed to `hero-1.mp4` (which exists)
2. ✅ Added leading slash: `/videos/hero-1.mp4`
3. ✅ Simplified loading - video shows immediately when ready
4. ✅ Added `playsInline` for better mobile support

## Changes Made

### File Modified: `src/components/Hero.jsx`

#### Video Path:
```jsx
// Before (not working)
src="videos/hero.mp4"  ❌ File doesn't exist

// After (working)
src="/videos/hero-1.mp4"  ✅ File exists + proper path
```

#### Loading Logic Simplified:
```jsx
// Before - waited for multiple videos
const [loadedVideos, setLoadedVideos] = useState(0);
const totalVideos = 3;
// Complex counting logic...

// After - simple and instant
const [isLoading, setIsLoading] = useState(true);
// Shows as soon as video is loaded
```

## Available Videos

Based on your `/public/videos` folder:
- ✅ `hero-1.mp4` ← **Currently using this**
- ✅ `hero-2.mp4`
- ✅ `hero-3.mp4`
- ✅ `hero-4.mp4`
- ✅ `feature-1.mp4` to `feature-5.mp4`

---

## What Now Works

✅ **Video displays immediately** when loaded  
✅ **Correct file path** with leading slash  
✅ **No switching** on click  
✅ **Loops continuously**  
✅ **Mobile friendly** with playsInline  
✅ **Loading screen** shows until video ready  

---

## Result

Your hero section should now display `hero-1.mp4` (your arcade joystick graphic) immediately when it loads. The video will:
- Auto-play on page load
- Loop continuously
- Never switch to other videos
- Work on mobile devices

**Status:** ✅ FIXED - Video should now be visible!

## If You Want to Use a Different Video

You can change the video by updating line 70:
```jsx
// Use hero-2.mp4
src="/videos/hero-2.mp4"

// Use hero-3.mp4
src="/videos/hero-3.mp4"

// Or any other video
src="/videos/your-video.mp4"
```

Just make sure the file exists in `/public/videos/` folder!
