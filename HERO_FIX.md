# üéØ Hero Section Fix - Mini Video Preview Removed

## Issue Fixed ‚úÖ

**Problem:** A square video preview was appearing in the center of the hero section, showing clips that would pop up on hover/click.

**Solution:** Completely removed the mini video preview feature for a cleaner, uninterrupted viewing experience.

## Before vs After

### Before:
```jsx
// Had 3 video elements:
1. Mini preview (center square) - Interactive
2. Next video (hidden) - For transitions
3. Main video (background) - Auto-playing

// User could hover/click center to switch videos
```

### After:
```jsx
// Now has 1 video element:
1. Main video (background) - Auto-playing only

// Clean, uninterrupted hero experience
```
