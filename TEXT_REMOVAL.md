**Removed:** Large "KHEL" and ".FUN" text overlays from the hero section

### Deleted Elements:

1. **Top Left "KHEL" text**
   - Large glowing white text
   - Positioned in upper left corner
   
2. **Bottom Right ".FUN" text (inside video frame)**
   - Blue glowing text

## What Remains:

âœ… **Video background** with your logo graphic (the arcade joystick)  
âœ… **Corner accents** (cyberpunk style decorations)  
âœ… **Navbar** with all navigation links  
âœ… **Loading screen** with progress bar  
âœ… **All animations** and scroll effects  

---

## Result:

Your hero section now shows **only the video background** with your animated logo/graphic (the arcade joystick with "Khel.fun" text in the video itself). The overlaying text elements have been completely removed for a cleaner look.

**Status:** âœ… Text overlays removed - clean hero section!
