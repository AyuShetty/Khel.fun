# 🎯 Video Switching Removed - Static Video Fix

## Issue Fixed ✅

**Problem:** Clicking in the center of the screen was cycling through different video files (hero-1.mp4, hero-2.mp4, hero-3.mp4, hero-4.mp4), changing the graphic unexpectedly.

**Solution:** Completely removed video switching functionality. Now displays only **one static video** that loops continuously.

- ❌ Deleted `getVideoSrc()` helper function

#### 2. **Simplified Video Display**
- ✅ Single video element only
- ✅ Hardcoded to `videos/hero-1.mp4`
- ✅ Auto-plays and loops continuously

## Before vs After

### Before:
```jsx
// Had 4 videos cycling on click
videos/hero-1.mp4 → videos/hero-2.mp4 → videos/hero-3.mp4 → videos/hero-4.mp4

// Click center = switch video with GSAP animation
```

### After:
```jsx
// Has 1 video playing continuously
videos/hero-1.mp4 (loops forever)

// Click center = nothing happens
```

## What Still Works

✅ **Loading Screen** - Progress bar animation  
✅ **Single Video Background** - hero-1.mp4 auto-plays  
✅ **Corner Accents** - Cyberpunk decorations  
✅ **Scroll Animations** - Clip-path morphing  
✅ **All Other Components** - Navbar, features, etc.  

---

## What Was Removed

❌ Video switching on click  
❌ Multiple video files loading  
❌ GSAP video transition animations  
❌ Hidden clickable areas  
❌ Complex state management  

---

## Result

Your hero section now:
- **Displays one consistent graphic** (hero-1.mp4)
- **No surprises when clicking** - click does nothing
- **Cleaner, simpler code** - easier to maintain
- **Faster loading** - only loads 1 video instead of 4
- **Better UX** - predictable behavior

## Testing

✅ Click anywhere on hero section → No change  
✅ Video plays continuously → Loops smoothly  
✅ No console errors  
✅ Loading screen works  
✅ Scroll animations intact  

**Status:** ✅ FIXED - Video no longer switches on click! Only hero-1.mp4 plays continuously.
